First project ever

I want to multiply two numbers (single digits) from 6-10
I use my fingers to represent each number in one hand with following mapping:
thumb 6
index 3
middle 8
finger 9
pinky 10
Join all the fingers that reprent the 2 numbers being mutiplied
then count how many fingers there are joined . *10
lastly count roaming fingers from left hand and multiply by roaming fingers in right hand
finaly step: add step #4 with step #5
